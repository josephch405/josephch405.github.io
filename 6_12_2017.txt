Typing more and more, just feeling like I'm dropping. Just dropping. Falling down, aimless, just wanting to collapse and to deal with it all later cause I'm just not worthy of anything, not worthy of myself, and I can never find my way out of all this. Can I find a way to become more? To take a deep breath, hold myself between the cliffs that I am whizzing by, then take a look? Everything is OK. There isn't so much to fear, because I decide how I feel about things. I should be a person who looks at challenge and thinks to himself, what's the best way to scale this cliff? Then I'll clench my fists and soul, heave myself up to one level higher, and then continue on again. Perhaps it may take a few cycles, this constant battle of mine. Regardless. I want to know what I want, and I will climb up towards that. My feet may tremble, and my fingers may slip - but my gaze shall remain steady, my will undeterred. I shall scale the cliffs of my own consciousness, and emerge every once in a while, refreshed, bettered, grown. This is what it means to live. This is who I must, and am, become.
