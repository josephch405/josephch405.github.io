Just a quick minddump I suppose. Hand is kinda clammy, sweating a lot too. Writing is hard, for some reason. Need hydration too. Feels like my right arm is deadened by being battered to death. Definitely need a workout.
Trying to capture my state of mind...it isn't really much of one right now. A rock, chipped away and weathered, sitting at the bottom of the vast ocean. It sees the fish, swimming in schools above it. And it just stares, just kinda sits there, perhaps scolding itself for its own pathetic state. Or, in other moments, not doing anything at all and wallows in the darkness. There are other rocks, perhaps aspiring to be more, but really, none of them will. They're fucking rocks.
Daryl looked at his watch, and he was late. Perhaps he would have been better off, mostly in terms of his state of mind, had he not looked at his watch - wallow in the bliss of uncertainty. But he decided to look - and now the cat's gone and died. He stood up from the rock that he'd been sitting on. The creek - or was it more of a river? - was as vibrant as ever, as were the brown orange leaves scattered above the waterfall, on the soil, and occasionally caught by the gusts of wind, brushing his sides. The day was a relaxing, sunny one - it could be worse, Daryl mused to himself. The trees agreed, especially the one that lay fallen across the stream - knocked down by the blizzard a few moons ago. Moons. WHy that expression? Well, Daryl like the moon. It was calming, soothing, it was the synechdoche for a calm and peaceful night. But it was day, so no moon here. At least, not to Daryl - even if it did show up during the day, he would refuse to acknowledge so. The moon must appear during the night - for that defines the moon, that it not be the sun.
