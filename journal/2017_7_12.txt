Screw the whole writing to everybody idea - this is fine. Sometimes it's not worth it to think too hard about whether I'm presenting this to somebody else, and just easier to focus on the WRITING. Dammit.
But yeah, spent a SHIT ton of money on a dinner today. I guess all in all it wasn't a bad experience - but it did feel a bit weird. Why, exactly? I've had expensive meals before. I guess it's more of the realization that nothing's stopping me from making big decisions - and that's a little scary. How immature, I guess. And I'm really tired right now so I notice that I'm again reverting back to my angsty, self-righteous style of writing I've had since the end of high school, the know it all attitude that became so sarcastic and powerful that it just has to mock itself and revel in the fact that it had become self aware, hence hypocritical, hence disproving any rational order to the universe. Or at least, from its perspective.
So much to tackle, so little time, so many things I could work on. But I have to remain...focused? Do I? What is it that I should work on?
Let's review.
Am I happy? I'm working on that. I think I'm a bit happier when I talk and connect to people. I'm a bit happier when I walk slower, when I just enjoy things without being harried all the time. How I fear the moment, though, when I stop and I listen to the silence that envelops me - the silence drowned out by the clatter of progress and work and jobs and money and talking and fear and dreams and hopes and maybe just a little bit of love and hate. Strong, pure emotion. Just, spatter the brain on the floor. And let it all go.
This sounds angsty again. And almost suicidal, but I don't think I'd ever have the energy nor the particular disposition for that. Let's hope it remains that way.
