Can the silence go away? I need some noise now. I wanna crackle and pop and fizzle and turn into something new, something marvelous. Because why not? Marvelousness is quite the quality to have. To be of something new, something novel. To recompose one self, and to relive one's dreams. The blissful release of mindfulness, to be and remain aware, to pour out the river of thoughts into the word and call it creation, creation! To bring and assign value - to recognize that value is inherent to the world, but not unique in the worldly - there is a deeper layer here. If we all recognize this, if value is universal, then we are universal.
Daryl looked up. He thought about the problem. It was a tricky one, but triky in the sense that he was now fully engrossed, in it out of necessity. His breath deepened, his heart raced. The clock was counting. He projected his thoughts - the dozens of possibilities and he had to combine them, synthesize the new, and then finally push them to the pen. He lept back, scribbled over a derivation, then skipped forward again to update the conclusion. The symbols lay sacred, each sealed and packed with meaning, each humming an "ohm" that vibrated gently on the page, their significance! How all the symbols were interwoven, that they collect and combine to become trailblazers of thought. The clock ticks. Daryl felt his palm, his slightly moist fingertips - he needs the time. Yet he no longer felt it - its passing, the knoll of each minute lost. He was within the infinitisimal transition between the nanoseconds, and his mind was in and of itself an entity, a mindful consciousness, the breeze of cold spring the onnly sign of the passage of time.
