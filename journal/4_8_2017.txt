Writing more per day seems like a good idea.
Just, like, about anything really.
I mean, my handwriting's progressively getting worse and so is my composition.
Maybe all those english classes weren't completely useless. 
I'll probably stick to a certain number of words for no - a lot easier to track that way.
Or just, some number of lines. A page sounds good. 
The cacaphony of voices, vying, twisting, contorting to burst and bloom centerstage. The colors that swirl, the smoke that rotates and obscures to beautify our fantastic reality.
If we do want more, what's stopping us? But can we live with less? Quantity seems to be orthogonal to difficulty. Or at least weakly correlated. Music? What of it? Why do I like it? Just chemicals? Chemicals, all the way down? Chem majors must be so happy. Think big now. Landscapes, the rippling hills before the colossal mountains towering far away, capped with sprinkles of snow. The sky a clear blue, with wisps that travel, perhaps from New York to Taipei, wisps so silent when far away, the winds that leap and plunge above intertwinedwith each other in chain, the first to the next, all that exists up high. Can I ever hope to fly, up with these dragons above, the streams of pure, uninhibited forces, of nature, singing, singing, singing, of a song...and will I ever land? Will I ever return home safely, both feet on the ground, hands and arms outstretched to welcome the earth, the grass, the trees that patiently wait? Do I tell them of my stories, my stories from above, from the heavens and dragons that soar beyond?
