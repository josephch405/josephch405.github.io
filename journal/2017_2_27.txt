Status check.
Dream was weird. Having more dreams now that I'm sleeping more, getting more REM which is great. I recallseeing my bro designing a dank ass videogame, grandparents and something about church...lol. Details getting fuzzier now.
But seriously. This isn't a good state of mind. I could have either gone to algo lecture, OR visited Kilian. But no, instead I spent it on reddit. Like - it's gratuitous at some point. Objectively, how much "fun" is good enough?

- Reddit? Content doesn't refresh much after a good 10 minutes, and new content appears every ~2hrs. Ergo one might spend up to 24 - 8(sleep) = 16 hours for this schedule - 16/(~2 hours) * 10 min = 80 min. Kinda scary tbh. Not bad if that keeps me updated but otherwise...need this in check.
- Games. Thing is, there's quite a lot of permutations to consider. Most recent events: Civ4, Overwatch, DX:HR, etc.
	Civ4/5: enjoyed it a lot before. I know I can grind in those games, but I only get gratification if I do well.
	Overwatch: good stress relief. Although not so much if I'm on a losing streak.
	DX:HR, steamworld, etc: some other random games?
	where does the gratification from the games come from anyway...
	It's about moving myself to a lower mental state, perhaps...
- Youtube/vid: This was the killer last week. Watching Yakuza. I enjoyed the storyand so this was sorta like binge watching a TV show. Video content: low involvement, high returns, low efficienty.

Something I've noticed: social avoidance. Seems to have excuses about not wanting to hang out with people: work, etc, mostly.
Then proceeds to ignore that work. Ending with disappointment on time alloc.
The mind is a muscle.
Hm.
So many potentially punny analogies.

(gratuitous): no shit. still is mate.
(games, permutations): overfit much?
overfitting...? Not very helpful analysis, need big, broad, immediately actionable things...
