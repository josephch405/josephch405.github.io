Reflection
This week is definitely hectic.
Concerns include CDS and Horizons not getting back to me, 3410 project by Friday, Algo hw by Thursday, ML project 1 by Friday, Earthquake quiz, 2930 hw, ITASA planning, second ML project, erc.
So many things.
So far the stress isn't completely overwhelming - in fact I did play piano and Overwatch yesterday. Hm...
Definitely need a break.
What are my goals again?
- Explore fields that interest you (and gain expertise?)
- Become financially independent
- Enhancing social experience
- SO?

The first thing - exploring fields.
That's going along quite OK atm.
Although I fear I might become a bit too narrowminded. Should read more, in a more serious manner.

Financial independence - 
Quite a long way to go. Sort of banking on a future job but learning to manage finances is a plus. Not living beyond my means. And wasting less.

Social - 
Arguably the most neglected aspect so far. It seems that perceived inferiority and a lack of initiation is the key issue.

And really, SO is kinda under social... but not really? What do I want?
I think it's just that...well that's some awkward phrasing.
I want someone I can share things with, and someone to cuddle with (once in a while?)
And the emotional support, I think. To be honest I'm not even sure - a priori experience.

Who am I, even? And do I wanna do?

I am a student studying computer science. I wanna do cool stuff, complicated, amazing, practical stuff.

I am someone that wants humanity to succeed. I want to contribute towards its success.

ADDENDUMS:
lol concerns? really... ok being harsh here, still petty as fuck but damn
"SO" - hahahaha...ha...
"narrowminded, read more" - what a beautiful, coherent thought)
