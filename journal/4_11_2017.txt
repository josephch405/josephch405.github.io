Daryl walked up the slope, his lithe body leaning a little, lilting back and forth. The smell of grass emanated around him, and Daryl breathed in the earthly air he so dearly missed during the winter. The path he walked on pointed to the clocktower - a modest tower that nevertheless towered over the rest of central campus. It was a calm day as usual - some people walked down the slope back to the dorms, some were trudging up with Daryl, and one girl was sitting crossed legged, horizontal to the slope, drawing on a sketchboard.
He sat in the lecture hall. It was a bit cold, and Daryl regretted not bringing his hoodie. The professor, a good-natured, bubbly lady, went on about something he'd already gone over in the book. So he drifted. He was sitting on the left quarter of the seats, whwere laptops were allowed - and so he opened up his laptop to read.
The girl next to him chuckled. Daryl looked up - and then noticed the room chuckling as a whole. Oops. Guess he missed a joke. He also happened to notice the girl. Then he went back to the book, nodding, trying to relate to the atmosphere of the room - but his mind was still wandering, and so he ended up juggling his attention between the slides, the book, the slides, the book, the girl?...
She coughed a little. "It's kinda cold." Daryl looked, and smiled in relief. "Yeah...forgot my jacket too." She smiled, ever so slightly. Backj to the lecture. The book. The girl. Lecture. Book. Lecturer. Slides. Book. Girl?
"Still kinda cold...haha..." She whispered. Daryl smiled again. If he had a jacket he could... "Well, 15 minutes left, so we're getting there..."
