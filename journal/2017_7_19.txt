Keep the hustle going. Develop. Train. Stay focused. Think. Exist. Breathe in the air, and refresh your head. Keep it that fresh. Keep it crisp, the thought process pristine, because that makes you. You are your thoughts - and they may be influenced by other things, but mostly yourself. You. Your thoughts. And your heart. Building focus is hard, but it is in the end worth it. You become stronger. But at the same time, you realize that you are no longer strong. Your training error approaches your testing error; your biases slowly go away, and you learn to be objective. But at the same time, you can change your position - you can also be subjective, because other people are subjective. You learn to think in the shoes of others. The unimportant clears away. The mission becomes clearer, more precise, more concise. What ties me to this world? Who am I? What role do I play? What do I care about? Use that. Harness that. Drive yourself with that.
