Repopulating physical journal entries is a lot a work...cause a page is just slightly more than what I usually time. Good typing practice though - spell checkers are admittedly getting the better of me. Why not find a way to fit drawings to SVGs? Obviously I might need some highly biased model, but maybe it's doable...will need to research SVG formats but that's fine. And it'll probably be some ensemble method where I seed new segments and then try to "grow" them. Now that I think about it...CNNs? Or some kind of Rnn? How well can I actually train this thing anyway? Does it even make sense to make this a supervised problem?
In any case - spending a shit ton of time on the ANN was great. Next obvious step is to make it multilayer, but that should be easy. Cool cool cool. (Community references? Really?)
In any case - I still need to understand what I want from social relationships. Do I want more? I doubt it's that straightforward. Am I just unmotivated to find others? To conenct? Time will tell, I suppose.
