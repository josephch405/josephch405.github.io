Let's talk about music. To me, music is linked to dreams. They are both very potent forces in terms of their ability to affect and reveal our psyche - the more cultural, intractable aspects of our thought processes. Yet precisely because of this, I believe they are fundamentally mysterious to the rational mind. This should be obvious with dreams - neuroscientists don't even have a full explanation on why we have them, much less on how exactly they work. Music is similar to that for me because, although there may be well established rules and musical patterns which allow people to scientifically analyze music, the Human responding to music can be totally unpredictable. And that's arguably the true purpose OF music -- to catalyze people. 
Almost as if a song were a jar of sweet, sweet ambrosia, and once you open a jar, the colors spill out, painting the canvas around you and the ground you stand on. All becomes hallowed, because there is so much FEELING. The human morphs from a cold, logical rock into an irrational being of love, hate, excitement, sadness, and anything in between.
