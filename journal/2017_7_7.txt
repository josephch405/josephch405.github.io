Cover: Shiki no Uta () - MINMI, Nujabes

A very calm, soulful song. A bit of a nostalgia trip if you watched Samurai Champloo back then. It's OK if you don't recognize it - I barely understand the lyrics.

So I went on a bit of a hiatus from sharing music. I still played a little, but my official excuse was that I didn't have time during the semester. The real reason, though, was probably a lack of direction - I didn't really know why I was recording. Was I just doing it for my own ego? Is that wrong? I mean, everyone needs a sense of self, and the word "ego" literally means "I". That aspect never really goes away, I think - the self awareness, the sense that I'm just doing it cause it makes myself feel important. Eh.

I remember a certain conversation I had with @Matt Fagen. It was memorable not only because I was looking back at high school with him - it was about something he told me on music. Grossly paraphrasing here (sorry).

"There are a lot of people who can play crazy riffs on a guitar - but they only impress other hardcore guitar players. The style of music that you made - it was something everyone could access, and that's important. And so as long as you're not selfish about the music, I think you'll be alright."

So my ultimate goal for doing this - and over time I hope to match this self-expectation - is to simply deliver music. It might not be the best music, nor the most meaningful - but that's my goal. To make music on a weekly basis. Feel free to remind me if I forget/you have not much else to do.
