Focusing on what matters - sometimes I think I need to take real breaks. Periods of time where I'm not hustling and not blinded by the fast things going on around me, but to walk gently among the autumn leaves and observe them fall in their grace. The grace of a family walking down the sidewalk, a mother with a baby in her arms. The grace of a group of students, idyllically walking down Campus Road and whispering. Graceful, graceful - I am still such a brute. Yet there is some joy, and dare I say it, some merit, in being brash. When the soul rips itself open, its hot innards spilling out onto the floor and the walls around it. Bam. The excitement, the electric sparks in the air that twist and pulse and turn and twist again, the air charging at me and me charging the air. So perhaps these are the modals of life - the calm and the violent, the pensive and the energetic, the thoughtful and the blind.
