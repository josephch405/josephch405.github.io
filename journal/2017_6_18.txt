Writing is a habit I want to really improve at - and for what reasons, I ask myself? Half the time it's the moments where I look at others who write, and by that I mean those who write well and write a lot. Exposition is such a crucial skill for a human being - being able to not only clearly express a thought or opinion, but to champion it with force, to buffet others with powerful words that can effect change. And therefore while the initial drive may be one out of jealousy ("wow, why don't I write blog posts like that?"), I choose to believe that there is a higher purpose that makes this worth the consistent effort. That higher reason is a stronger integration with those around me - good writing should be an enabling skill, one that elevates faculties all around the board.
There must be a balance between the external and intrinsic compulsions that drive a person. Being dependent on others makes a person a husk; yet relying solely on the self results in a detachment from reality, a self-absorbed existence that benefits no-one. Perhaps all we can really do is to tune it - maybe with some kind of grid search with k-fold cross validation? - and to discover the true distribution of life. And perhaps having a strong prior isn't always that bad - after all, all models run on assumptions.
