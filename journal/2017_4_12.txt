So underprepared for algo. But time to decompose a little. Try and think about what to do next. But really, it's just all classes isn't it? A relentless waterfall of tumbling assignments, projects, expectations, failures, self doubt, etc etc. My heart is not getting the good end of this deal. It's burning. A halo of dim, orange light, belying the pent up heat and frustration that chips away at my corpse, my hands, my face. The breath of fire consuming and entropy just bursting in bounds, the dragon that hallows and burns the air, rearing its black, scaly rugged head, a beast, a monster, a monster! How is it that I can trek for so long but have arrived so close to where I started? The footprints behind, taunting me, telling me that I have learned nothing, that I was almost coming full circle, and the muddy path always meets the rain. The storm ahead blisters in a most ominous fashion, and it simply waits, it doesn't even bother to taunt me, to recognize me, to at least laugh with the footprints...the frustration, how it builds, how it soars and overtakes the eagle, the bright eyed eagle! But it has been clawed, its wings shredded by this monster of the abyss, flailing and remorseful. The shroud consumes all, it is indiscriminate, and it is ignorant. The blunt of a hammer hits - against the skull, cracking the fissures that sewed the left to the right, the front to the back, and now all is in pieces, all is woe. Lost! Lost! And never to be found again, I'm afraid. Better luck of the draw next time. Presumably you wish to play again? To fall, to see everything lost and ruined? But of course. One must. For otherwise, one does not, and that is a fate worse than death.
