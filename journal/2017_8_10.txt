I felt a bit out of place. Well, there was another girl one year older than me (I wonder when I'll start referring to them as women), but still. The median age had to be about 12 or something. I was a lot older than 12.
And of course, it was awkward as hell. This was my second day ever touching squash, and I was significantly less experienced compared to the kids.
I won't go into the details of the class, but I'm just writing down the general impression I had from it. It evoked some memories - memories with my brother, when we were at classes and I was half assing things. Funny thing is there was a kid I got paired up with that probably had the same approach I had back then. He would go all out for the first laps, but then start skimping out and pretending that he was in a sense better than the exercises. And from my percpective now, that was a big problem - thinking that you can miss out on the fundamentals cause you can visualize a certain activity.
That is immature thinking in two ways - physically and mentally. First, it's quite obvious that being able to follow something hardly translates to actionable proficiency. Just cause you watch a lot of basketball doesn't mean you are able to play well. But the mental barrier - that one's a lot harder, cause it's less obvious. The fool is always overconfident, and people who know more realize that they don't know stuff at all. There's a specific phenomenon associated with this - I don't remember the name of it, but it has had a resurgence in popularity among contemporary political and social discussion. So simply vizualizing something can be a dangerous thing. There are so many other ways to understand a certain topic, each contributing its own unique share towards the ground truth, and so thinking that visualization is all that it takes to become proficient is a self-deceiving thought process.
