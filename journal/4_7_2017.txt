Time for a word dump.
Maybe I should meditate or look into the spiritual side of things more. I mean, even if factually there's little evidence to justify the validity of such behavior, it seems to provide tangible benefits. In some circumstances.
Or I just need to work up my confidence. What is living, though? As in, living well and with purpose. Maybe I should try to solve the world's problems. Is it hypocritical to be so existential about things when some are still suffering from worldly pains?
But then what? Do we elevate people, simply to present them with the sisyphean conundrum that is middle/upper class existence? Are we miserable all across the board? Sure hope not.
