Let's type more. 7 habits is a pretty good book actually - a lot of learning, I'm realizing just now, has a certain depth to it, and I often ignore that, as if a single pass is sufficient for me to internalize information. Apparently that is quite far from how it really works. And also, everything I do, I should view it as a choice. Actually - to be more precise - I should just be a lot more aware of whether or not something is the result of my choice. No more blaming the external, because there's not much I can do about that. I suppose this will be a process. And I must take this road, cause...I must build myself back up again. Or not really an "again" thing, really - building anew, trying to rise out of the muck that my subconcious grips onto, the will weathered and weakened, where I respond instead of do. Hard stuff, but good stuff.6/16/2017
